# üè° Airbnb Data Analysis & Recommender System

## üìä Project Overview

This project presents a complete data science pipeline for analyzing Airbnb rental listings and building a content-based recommendation engine. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes ~70,000 listings.   
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lovishbansal123/airbnb-data/data)

The goal is to predict listing prices and provide personalized recommendations based on listing descriptions, using both machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## üîß Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning:
  - Missing value imputation using KNN and statistical methods
  - Normalization and transformation of price using `log1p`
  - Encoding of categorical features

- Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Distribution of prices across locations, host types, amenities
  - Correlations between price and features such as room type, availability, review count

- Price prediction models:
  - Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
  - Decision Tree, Random Forest
  - **CatBoost (best): R¬≤ = 0.69, MSE = 0.15**

- Content-based Recommendation System:
  - Description text vectorized with **TF-IDF**
  - Cosine similarity to find similar listings
  - Results returned as top 5 most similar listings

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost
- NLTK, TfidfVectorizer (NLP)
- HDF5 (for storing similarity matrix efficiently)
